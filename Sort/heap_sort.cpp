// Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure.
// Like merge sort but unlike insertion sort, heapsortâ€™s running time is O(nlogn)
// Like insertion sort but unlike merge sort, heapsort sorts in place:
// only a constant number of array elements are stored outside the input array at any time.
// Not only is the heap data structure useful for heapsort, but it also makes an efficient priority queue.
// The (binary) heap data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree.
// The tree is completely filled on all levels except possibly the lowest, which is filled from the left up to a point.
